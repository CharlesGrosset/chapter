## Overview
After reading Chris Beams' [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit) and being advocate of [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com), I thought it was time to mix these two. Chapter ensures a convention for writing and auditing Git commit messages.

## Project TODO 
+ Integrate with an open source proof-reading tool (http://wiki.languagetool.org/public-http-api)
+ Add a config file for adding/removing rules (default includes all)
+ Audit each GitHub message after completing `git commit` (alternative: `git commit -m "..."`)
  + Execute program on a `hook` when `git push` is executed
+ Setup test suite
+ Update project name, overview, and add logo
